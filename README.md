Here is the data of predictands and predictors for turbidity and total organic carbon (TOC) models at the Tesla Treatment Facility (Tesla Portal) in the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System, California, the United States. 

Here is the explanation of column names.
1. date: Measured date
2. Turb_Tesla: Turbidity at the Tesla Portal/ TOC_Tesla: TOC at the Tesla Portal
3. Q_HH_cfd_sum1: Cumulative flows in the previous water year in cubic feet
4. ADD_HH_sum1: Cumulative dry days in the previous water year
5. SJPL_mgd: San Joaquin Pipeline flow in million gallons per day
6. V_HH_af: Hetch Hetchy storage in acre-feet 
7. SR_HH_cfs: Hetch Hetchy spill and release in cubic feet per second
8. CPT_cfs: Canyon Power Tunnel flow in cubic feet per second 
9. Ta_HH_C: Hetch Hetchy air temperature in degree Celsius
10. ADD_HH: Hetch Hetchy antecedent dry days
11. Q_HH_cfd: Hetch Hetchy inflow in cubic feet per day
12. ADD_HH_sum: Cumulative dry days until the predictive date in the current water year
13. Q_HH_cfd_sum: Cumulative flows until the predictive date in the current water year in cubic feet 
14. Tw_Tesla_C: Tesla water temperature in degree Celsius
